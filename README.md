# Quine-McCluskey-Prime-Implicants-Generator
This repository houses an implementation of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm tailored specifically for generating prime implicants from Boolean functions. Prime implicants play a crucial role in the minimization of Boolean expressions, providing essential insights into the logic structure of the functions.
